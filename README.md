# Advanced Regression Assignment Part -1
Surprise Housing, a US-based real estate company, is expanding its operations to the Australian market and aims to leverage data analytics to identify lucrative investment opportunities. To achieve this, the company has compiled a dataset from the Australian housing market, which is provided in the accompanying CSV file. The objective is to develop a regression model with regularization techniques to predict the true values of potential properties. This predictive model will aid Surprise Housing in making informed decisions about whether to invest in these properties. The key questions the company wants to address include identifying the significant variables influencing house prices and assessing how effectively these variables explain variations in property prices. Additionally, the analysis aims to determine the optimal values of lambda for both ridge and lasso regression, providing valuable insights for the company's investment strategy in the Australian real estate market.

The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.
